# Overlay drawing tool

This tool was primarily created to overlay lines from wrist/elbow on videos, to better understand why I suck at disc golf. Could be useful for other ppl, idk

```sh
uv run main <path_to_input_file> <path_to_output_file> [--points rw,re,lw,le] [--trails rw,re,lw,le] [--lines re-rw,le-lw]
```
